Scan Your NFC Tag

What Gets Created
For each reminder, the integration creates three sensors:

sensor.{name}_last_scan - Formatted date/time of last scan
sensor.{name}_days_since_scan - Number of days since last scan
sensor.{name}_progress - Progress percentage (0-100%)
The progress sensor also includes helpful attributes:

status: "good", "warning", or "overdue"
interval: Your configured interval
interval_unit: Your configured unit
nfc_tag_id: The NFC tag ID
Usage with Custom Cards
This integration works great with custom Lovelace cards. Here's an example configuration:

yaml
type: custom:nfc-reminder-card
use_home_assistant_storage: true
reminders:
  - name: "Furnace Filter"
    entity_id: input_datetime.furnace_filter_last_scan
    person_entity_id: input_text.furnace_filter_last_changed_by
    nfc_tag: "your-nfc-tag-id"
    interval: 90
    unit: "days"
  - name: "Litter Box 1"
    entity_id: input_datetime.litter_box_1_last_scan
    person_entity_id: input_text.litter_box_1_last_cleaned_by
    nfc_tag: "another-tag-id"
    interval: 2
    unit: "days"

Troubleshooting
Integration doesn't appear in the list:

Ensure all files are in /config/custom_components/nfc_reminders/
Restart Home Assistant completely
Check Configuration ‚Üí Logs for any errors
NFC tag scans don't update the timestamp:

Verify the tag ID matches exactly (check notifications when you scan)
Ensure the input_datetime helper entity exists
Go to Developer Tools ‚Üí Events and listen to tag_scanned to see if events are firing
Sensors show "Unknown":

Make sure the integration created the input_datetime helper automatically
Scan the NFC tag at least once
Verify entity names match (check Settings ‚Üí Devices & Services ‚Üí Entities)
